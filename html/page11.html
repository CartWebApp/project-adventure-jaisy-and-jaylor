    <p>You: You know I find it strange how our grandfather has passed awayâ€¦ He seemed very healthy.</p>
    <p>Bron: I find it strange too, but anything could have happened too.</p>
    <p>You: Yeah, you're right.</p>
    <p>Auntie Mei: Hey, if you want to look at your grandfather's stuff you can head to the outdoor shed. He would often be out there when he was here.</p>
    <p>Bron: Do you want me to come with you?</p>
